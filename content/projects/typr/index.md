This [React](https://reactjs.org/) app is the product of a collaboration with long time friend and fellow programmer [Chris Palmieri](https://palmo.xyz). The backend was originally built in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (because I'm obsessed with Python) but later rewritten with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
