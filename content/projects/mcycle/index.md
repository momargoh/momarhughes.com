MCycle is one of my babies. What started as a collection of Python scripts to assist me with calculations for my Ph.D. quickly turned into a scalable, open-source Cython project with documentation. The source code is hosted on Github at https://github.com/momargoh/MCycle, the documentation is hosted by ReadTheDocs, accessible via https://mcycle.momarhughes.com.
