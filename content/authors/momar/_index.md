I have been programming, for close to a decade, in start-ups, open source projects and as a freelancer. Python has always been my bread and butter but more recently I've been honing my skills in Javascript. I'm an Aeronautical Engineering Ph.D. Candidate and work as a casual academic at my university. I also co-founded an online university tutoring business: Distance Tuition.
