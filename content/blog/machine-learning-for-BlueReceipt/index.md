I was recently invited to apply for a position at [BlueReceipt.com](https://www.bluereceipt.com/), an upcoming text marketing tech startup based in the USA. As with any email I receive from an unknown sender offering me anything or inviting me to click on any hyperlinks, I was initially suspicious,  (who would even want me working for them anyway right?!) so much so that I actually replied with an email that just said "Are you a real business?" ðŸ˜‚. But I took the time to have a little look into them and sure enough, their beautifully designed landing page (no really, check it out it's great!) and active twitter account reiterated that they're definitely not scammers and they're hiring. So, I thought I'd write a little opinion piece about my thoughts on a future direction of BlueReceipt: machine learning.

## TL;DR
Leaving marketing choices up to the business owner relies a lot on how business-savvy they are. Machine learning could be incorporated to help them make better decisions about their marketing strategies.

## Who is BlueReceipt?
Well, what I gather from scouring their online presence, they're a tech start-up that is building an advanced marketing platform for Shopify that has text message marketing as one of its core features. I thought that was interesting and refreshing, to see a company backing text messages as the future of marketing, it's basically coming full circle. I think that email marketing is certainly not as effective as many tout it to be; I certainly skim over the barrage of marketing emails I find in my "junk email account" and am quite fast to click unsubscribe. Receiving text messages is different for me though, ironically because I hardly ever use them. I use Whatsapp for most of my chatting with friends and family and so when I do receive a text message it's usually something important; post tracking updates, login codes, appointment reminders. The email marketing space is certainly very crowded and so competing for space in the text marketing space is an interesting tactic.

I assume that Shopify is step one in their long-term goal; I don't see why the company would limit itself to providing their platform just for Shopify accounts. WooCommerce would be the next obvious framework to target. The services they provide are quite broad: auto response to empty carts, marketing broadcasts, CTA pop-ups, streamlining your email and social media inboxes into one and analytics. A lot of features that are bound to attract small to medium businesses look to reduce time spent on marketing.I think it will be a very interesting company to follow in the coming years.

## Where does Machine Learning factor in?
For me, beyond the obvious of rolling out to other shop frameworks and growing the power of their current features, a future direction that the company should pursue is machine learning for marketing advice. Let me expand: currently, all of the companies features revolve around streamlining a business' marketing and advertising; finding everything you want in one (very aesthetically pleasing) place. However, it's still up to the business to write and schedule broadcasts, automated messages and pop-ups. What would really put a business ahead is intelligent help for these tasks by learning about their customer base. That way BlueReceipt would not only be streamlining a marketing plan, but optimising it.

So what could ML be applied to exactly? (This is where having a partner with an advertising degree comes in handy)

1. **Time of day to send messages**. Now this is a classic in marketing right: your client base is more likely to be active online, or responding to their phone at certain times of the day. So sending a message at the right time makes a big difference. But you could go beyond just getting a feel for that yourself by applying ML to optimise based on the responses you get. This may be something that varies throughout a year (particularly one as tumultuous as 2020!) in different ways depending on your customers. For example a business who is selling largely to new parents will find the level of response varies differently throughout the year compared to a business that targets young adults.
2. **Response to keywords**. Do you know which words trigger your particular customers to respond? Choice of words is hugely important in all forms of communication: nobody can sense your subcious intent over the internet, they can only read the text you send. ML could provide a lot of insight into which words to use in your messages, which to avoid, which not to overuse etc. This is definitely something that would be much harder for a human to judge through intuition, but a computer can easily analyse responses.
3. **Types of marketing to focus on**. Your business is very, very unlikely to be the only business of its type on the internet. ML can gather data from other business like yours to make suggestions as to what type of marketing you should be targeting, ie; should you be going heavier on pop-ups or is it best to have a daily, or weekly broadcast. Again, this is the benefit of using ML on a large dataset; you can see what is working best for your competitors and use that to make your own marketing decisions.

I think the list could go on, but hopefully you get the point: ML that has been fed data from all the businesses using BlueReceipt can be used to provide tailored advice to individual businesses. I think this could be the next step, a few years down the track, that really sets BlueReceipt apart as more than just a very pretty all-in-one marketing platform.
